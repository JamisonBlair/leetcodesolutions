# leetcodesolutions
LeetCode (https://leetcode.com/) is a site full of programming exercises/puzzles meant to keep programming wizards skills sharp. 
This is a simple repository made up of solutions to a few I have solved using Python, written in a Python notebook. 
This is mostly an exercise for myself to practice writing out the solutions and explanations. I'm welcome to criticism
and help. I'm always wanting to learn more. 
That being said, the goal here is to showcase my personal approach, and not neccesarily to display the 'best' (i.e. fastest and most memory efficient)
in this notebook.
