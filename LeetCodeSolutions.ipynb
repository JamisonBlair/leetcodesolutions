For example, suppose $n=8$ and $B$ is a solution to the $8$-Queen problem. If $r$ is the top row in $B$ and $B'$ is the board we get from removing $r$ from $B$, then $B'$ is a solution to the $7$-queen variant of the question on a $7 \\times 8$ board. So if we want to solve the $8$-Queens on the $8\\times 8$ board, we start with the $1$-Queen on $1\\times 8$ board (i.e. all rows with a single queen), then tackle the $2$-queens on an $2\\times 8$ board, etc.\n",

In the program, we start with the base level ($1\\times n$ boards) and use checkNewRow to find all possible $2\\times n$ boards, save them, and repeat the process until we have solutions to the $n\\times n$ boards.\n",
